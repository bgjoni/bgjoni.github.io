                  <h3>How the Site Will Meet the Needs of the Users?</h3>
                
                    <p>
                     This is weather site and I ask myself this question: what do users need from weather site? The residents need to know, how is going to be the weather tomorrow and coming week.Is going to snow or not,is going to be winy or not. The drivers would want to know the dangerous routes so they can avoid them. Drivers will need to know blocked routes. This site will help chose their route according to the weather.The site will collect data from the police patrolling the roads. Different age groups expected to visit the website so it will be easy to navigate,through simple design.It will have little information but important one. Most of the users expected to use mobile devices so it will support very well this technology.

            <h4>How the site will meet the needs of the user</h4>
            
    <p>        I really like the amount of detail you included in this section as to how the data that you will include in your                  website will aid truckers specifically. I am a little curious as to where you will source the information regarding              accidents and closed passes as they are not included as data in the JSON file. However, if you can source this data,              it would be a really cool way to set apart you site form other weather related sites.
          </p>
            
            <h4>Wireframe Sketches</h4>
            <p>I like the clean design of your sketches. I would recommend adding some type of border to your designs so that the viewer of your website can establish some mental boundaries for your designs</p>
