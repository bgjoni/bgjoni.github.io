                <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this site is, to give accurate information to the drivers and residents about the weather 
                        in one of three cities. Drivers mainly will use the website to know weather conditions before travelling, during winter months. Information that this site will offer users will be: temperature, the highest and the lowest. It will show the wind speed. We expect drivers to plan according their trip and cancel in severe weather. It will provide weather information for residents so they get dressed accordingly for the day.
                        </p>
                <h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
               
                
                    <p>
                      Target for this website will be people with wide range of age from the college students to retired people. Income will be very different for all the users since weather forecast is important for high school student to director of big company.  Mainly will be used by drivers and residents of this area. It be for the residents as well for the drivers from this area or people driving though this area. 
                      It will be mobile friendly since many people travel and are outside and what to decide to walk to the train station or take a taxi.
                    </p>
                  <h3>How the Site Will Meet the Needs of the Users?</h3>
                
                    <p>
                     This is weather site and I ask myself this question: what do users need from weather site? The residents need to know, how is going to be the weather tomorrow and this week. If is going to snow or not, if is going to be winy or not. The drivers would want to know the dangerous routes so they can avoid them. Drivers will need to know blocked routes. This site will help chose their route according to the weather. Different age groups expected to visit the website so it will be easy to navigate. It will have little information but important one. Most of the users expected to use mobile devices so it will support very well this technology. 
                         </p>
