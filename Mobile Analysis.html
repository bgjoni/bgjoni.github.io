                <p> Oxfam is a charity site. It operates in different countries. When we first get in main page we do not know that this is a charity website; in first sight. It is hard to navigate. When you click the button donate, it takes you to Haiti hurricane and if you go down is another button donate.      In site of Emirate Airline, when you click book a flight, it takes you there. In the Oxfam site, it is difficult for the user to find what they want. </p>
